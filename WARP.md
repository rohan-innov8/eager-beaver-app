## Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Vite.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.

## Code Architecture

This is a React application built with Vite. The main application logic is in the `src` directory.

- `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The root component of the application.
- `vite.config.ts`: The configuration file for Vite.
- `package.json`: Contains the project's dependencies and scripts.
